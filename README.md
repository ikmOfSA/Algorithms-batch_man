# Algorithms-batch_man
Implement algorithm to solve the batch manufacturing problem of dynamic programming. Two approaches are implemented: the value iteration and the policy iteration. 

What's more, I wrote code to solve the system of equitions which are used in the algorithm, using techniques such as Gaussian Elimination and Partial Pivoting.

### Files
1. batch_man_value.c generates program that using the *value iteration* approach to solve the problem.
2. batch_man_policy.c generates program that using the *policy iteration* approach to solve the problem.
